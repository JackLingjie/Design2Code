I will provide you with an HTML code snippet that may not be visually appealing and lacks proper structure. Your task is to refactor this HTML code to make it more visually attractive and modern.  
  
Requirements:  
1. Return a single HTML file using HTML and CSS to recreate the given website.  
2. If there are any images, use "rick.jpg" as a placeholder and ensure that all images have appropriate size and positioning styles.  
3. Do not create any dependencies on external files, and do not include JavaScript scripts for dynamic interactions.  
4. Pay attention to the size, text, position, and color of all elements, as well as the overall layout, ensuring a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing design.  
5. Ensure the entire content can be displayed on a single page. If the original content is too extensive, redesign the layout to fit a single page display.  
6. Use semantic HTML tags to improve code readability and maintainability.  
7. Include CSS at the top or bottom of the page using the `<style>` tag.  
8. Apply responsive design principles to ensure good display across different devices.

<p>Heyevent was at one point the world's most popular event recommendation service with 600k+ registered users. We fetched events from Facebook and sent out weekly personal recommendations for upcoming events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to newly imposed limitations of the Facebook API, as well as expensive hosting costs and dwindling traffic, we've had to close down Heyevent and move on to new projects. Below are links to some other projects.</p>
